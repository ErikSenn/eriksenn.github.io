Hello it's me, Erik!

I am an Econometrics Ph.D. candidate in the [Graduate Programme in Economics and Finance at the University of St.Gallen](https://www.unisg.ch/en/research/phd/graduate-programme-in-economics-and-finance-gpef/). 
Under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Francesco Audrino](https://www.linkedin.com/in/francescoaudrino/) at the [Chair of Statistics](https://www.unisg.ch/de/universitaet/schools/school-of-economics-and-political-science-seps-hsg/ueber-die-seps/institute-fachbereiche-und-center/fachbereich-mathematik-und-statistik/chair-of-statistics/), I work on Applied Econometrics and Machine Learning problems in Economics and Finance.

I am enthusiastic about enriching the Machine Learning toolbox for Economists, and I apply Machine Learning to extract economically relevant information from novel data sources.

Currently, I work on the following topics:
- [Working paper](https://www.alexandria.unisg.ch/handle/20.500.14171/119138): "LongFinBERT: A Language Model for Very Long Financial Documents" (joint with Minh Tri Phan)
- Financial Sentiment from Social Media Images 
- Social Media Network Structure and Financial Decisions
- Data-driven interpretable AI for Economics and Finance

If you are interested in me or my work, get in contact and we can have a chat!
