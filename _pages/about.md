Hello it's me, Erik!

I am an Econometrics Ph.D. candidate in the [Graduate Programme in Economics and Finance at the University of St. Gallen](https://www.unisg.ch/en/research/phd/graduate-programme-in-economics-and-finance-gpef/). 
Under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Francesco Audrino](https://www.linkedin.com/in/francescoaudrino/) at the [Chair of Statistics](https://www.unisg.ch/de/universitaet/schools/school-of-economics-and-political-science-seps-hsg/ueber-die-seps/institute-fachbereiche-und-center/fachbereich-mathematik-und-statistik/chair-of-statistics/), I work on Applied Econometrics and Machine Learning in finance and economics.

I am enthusiastic about building modern Machine Learning tools for empirical finance and economics, and apply them to extract economically meaningful signals from new data sources.

**Current projects**
- Utility-optimal portfolio selection.
- Networks of retail investors. ([SNF grant](https://data.snf.ch/grants/grant/10006133))
- Data-driven interpretable Machine Learning using Symbolic Regression. Short overview of model selection consistency of Symbolic regression: [Conference paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3712255.3734334).
- Working paper: "[Read Them All at Once - Efficient Language Modeling for Very Long Financial Documents](http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.5011898)" (with Minh Tri Phan).
